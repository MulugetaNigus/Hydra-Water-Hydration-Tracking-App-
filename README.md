# Water Hydrate Tracking App
## This is a simple React Native application designed to help users track their daily water intake. It allows users to log the amount of water consumed, view progress towards their daily goal, and receive reminders to stay hydrated.

# Features
Track Water Intake: Users can log their water intake by adding preset amounts (e.g., 250 ml or 500 ml).
Daily Goal: The default goal is set to 2 liters (2000 ml), but users can update their goals.
Progress Bar: Displays a visual representation of the user's progress towards their daily hydration goal.
Persistent Storage: Water intake data is stored using AsyncStorage so that it persists across app sessions.
Alarms/Reminders: Users can receive reminders or alarms to drink water at regular intervals (optional feature).
